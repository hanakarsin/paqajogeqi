Following the downfall of <a href=#>Louis C.K</a>. and <a href=#>Harvey Weinstein</a>, Spacey was added to the long list of industry professionals with allegations against them.</p><p>In an article published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> in 2017, actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of assault. According to Rapp, he was 14 and Spacey was 26 when the actor made sexual advances toward him.</p><p>Later, Rapp filed a $40 million civil suit that claimed Spacey’s actions had caused him trauma "of a permanent and lasting nature," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>. In October 2022, after a three-week trial, a verdict was finally handed down in the case. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC</a> reported that it took the jury just a little over an hour to come to their decision and in the end, Spacey walked out of the courthouse a free man. So, what is Spacey up to now? He went back to work.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Kevin Spacey now? He's back in Hollywood.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Spacey's comeback film Peter Five Eight centers on the titular Peter (played by Spacey), an assassin without principles. A review in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> lambasts the actor's performance, calling him "a bit rusty when it comes to commanding the frame, sluggish in his attempts at intimidation." Like a post-Elvis Austin Butler, Spacey holds onto the Frank Underwood accent fans of House of Cards know so well.</p><p>Director Michael Hall defended his decision to cast Spacey by stating the "criminal justice system helped form his view that a recently exonerated Spacey shouldn’t be overlooked for a part he is perfect for," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Freaking Robot</a>. He went on to say that, "This is where innuendo and allegations are put under the microscope and looked at intensely from all angles. The allegations against him [Spacey] were put to the test and he was exonerated." The film had a limited run in March 2024 and is currently available to rent on Prime and YouTube.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kevin Spacey is the subject of a documentary.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reported that the United Kingdom's Channel 4 commissioned a two-part series titled Spacey Unmasked, in 2022. It's scheduled to premier on the British channel in May 2024 and "features interviews with multiple men, unconnected to the U.K. trial, speaking for the first time about their experiences with Spacey."</p><p>The docuseries has also been acquired by Warner Bros. Discovery although as of the time of this writing, a release date has yet to be announced. Variety reached out to Spacey for comment who sent a reply via his representation. "I’m honored to be starring in my first film with Warner Brothers in many years," said Spacey. "I hope the Academy takes note of some of the great acting by the lesser-known cast."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What did Anthony Rapp accuse Kevin Spacey of?</h2><p>Rapp and Spacey first met on Broadway. According to Rapp, the incident occurred in 1986 when Spacey threw a party at his Manhattan home. It was there, Rapp said, that he was put on a bed and later Spacey straddled him in a sexual manner. As a result of Spacey's behavior, Rapp claimed to have suffered “psychological injuries.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>An anonymous complainant also joined Rapp in the suit. The nameless victim alleged that he had shared a similar traumatic experience with the actor, although he requested his identity be kept under wraps.</p><p>Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Rapp told the court that he brought charges against the actor because he knew he was “not the only one.” However, Rapp and the anonymous plaintiff's accusations against Spacey weren’t enough to convince the jury that the actor deserved prison time. When the case concluded, he was deemed not liable for the assault. Spacey's lawyer, Jennifer Keller, later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> reporters, “I’m very grateful to the jury for seeing through these false allegations.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlm5rDqrqMrKeam5Wueq%2B71g%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./was-jeffrey-dahmer-a-cannibal.html>&#171;&nbsp;A Forensic Psychologist on Jeffrey Dahmer: &amp;quot;He's Empty Inside and This Is His Way to Feed His Emptin</a>
