In one, she reveals he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deeply afraid of commitment</a> but was fully capable of signing a 30-year mortgage with her when they bought a house together.</p><p>She goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@rachel_overshares</a> on TikTok, but in my opinion Rachel is sharing just the right amount. The most shocking video is of Rachel saying that "boy math is buying a house with your girlfriend, having her do all the work, packing up boxes and moving you both into this new house, and then nine weeks later sending a text message that you're not ready for this level of commitment." Remember the 30-year mortgage from the previous video?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@rachel_overshares href=#>@rachel_overshares</a><p>I still have a screenshot of that text. <a title=boymath href=#>#boymath</a> <a title=exboyfriend href=#>#exboyfriend</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Rachel" href=#>♬ original sound - Rachel</a></figure><p>In what feels like a fairly unhelpful comment, someone replied, "This is why I tell people do not buy houses with somebody unless you are married to them." Rachel responded with a simple yet effective, "I know."</p><p>Sadly, the rest of the comments were mostly people sharing similar tragic stories. "I once helped a partner move across the country for a new job," wrote @highuintas. "He was already thinking of leaving me but wanted me to help him move." (The way I would have "accidentally" backed up over his couch...)</p><p>Under yet another tale of cruelty, Rachel said that this was actually the best thing that ever happened to her. Based on her other TikToks, I couldn't agree more.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@rachel_overshares href=#>@rachel_overshares</a><p>I really like this trend. <a title=boymath href=#>#boymath</a> <a title=exboyfriend href=#>#exboyfriend</a> <a title=girlmath href=#>#girlmath</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Rachel" href=#>♬ original sound - Rachel</a></figure><p>One of my pet peeves is any man who has the audacity to tell a woman what to do with her body hair and, in particular, her pubic hair. I'm not surprised to learn Rachel's ex had some thoughts about hers. "Boy math is telling your girlfriend if she doesn't shave her private area, that's a dealbreaker for you ... but never once even taking scissors to yours."</p><p>A few TikToks later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel went into greater detail over what happened</a> with the ex. An eagle-eyed viewer noticed she was wearing a wedding ring and asked if the ex-boyfriend was from a few years ago.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@rachel_overshares href=#>@rachel_overshares</a><p>Replying to @Arlene <a title=reply href=#>#reply</a> <a title=videoreply href=#>#videoreply</a> <a title=momtok href=#>#momtok</a> <a title=trauma href=#>#trauma</a> <a title=relationshiptrauma href=#>#relationshiptrauma</a> <a title=exboyfriend href=#>#exboyfriend</a> <a title=recovery href=#>#recovery</a> <a title=hope href=#>#hope</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Rachel" href=#>♬ original sound - Rachel</a></figure><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok dated Oct. 6, 2023</a>, Rachel said the awful ex stories were from "five years ago in January." After the breakup, she moved back to her own hometown because where they bought the house was her ex's hometown. He was surrounded by family and friends, and she was stuck with him. "I just wanted to get the h--- away from everything," said Rachel.</p><p>Rachel moved into her mom's house which is outside of Milwaukee. Sadly her mother's house had been abandoned and was a bit of a hoarding situation, which presented new problems. "That's another story," Rachel said.</p><p>In order to get over her ex, Rachel decided to "get under someone else" and did so, several times. Atta girl! "I met my husband about six weeks after the breakup." Seven months later they were engaged then married. Rachel has no idea what her ex is up to. The important thing is, Rachel is "happily married now ... every day she wakes up and is so in love with her husband." Plus, they have an adorable toddler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7y6stGinKecXZe%2Fpq3KrGSuqF2Ws7Wx0WaZrrGZo7RutM6uqp4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./yasmin-evans-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Yasmin Evans - Age, Family, Bio</a>
