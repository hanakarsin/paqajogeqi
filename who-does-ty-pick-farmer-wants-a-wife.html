There was <a href=#>Melody</a>, who he had his first solo date with and who had remained close to him for most of the season. And then there was Megan, who would fit in his life so easily from day one if he chose her. But who did Ty pick on Farmer Wants a Wife and what was the outcome of his final two meetings?</p><p>Ty took time talking to both Melody and Megan privately during the finale. But when he made his final decision, both women were shocked and one of them delivered a teary speech about not being good enough. It was an emotional moment, but Ty stood behind his decision, even during the reunion.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who does Ty pick on 'Farmer Wants a Wife'?</h2><p>When Ty meets with Melody, he tells her, "You completely brought an energy to this place that I don't think anybody ever has." However, her life in the "big city" seems like something she can't just leave behind, and it worries Ty so much that he can't move forward with her, since to him, having any lingering doubts isn't a good idea of he were to start a real relationship with her.</p><p>"It's a hard thing to do, but it's the right thing to do," Ty explains. He breaks things off with Melody, however, Megan isn't out of the woods yet.</p><p>When Ty talks to Megan, he shocks her by making a remark about their relationship being more of a friendship. And, he admits, he doesn't fully believe she is the person he should be with. But there's more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>"Through this, there was a part of me that thought coming into it that I was open to children," Ty explains. "But for me to be honest, I've learned through it that I'm not 100 percent there… I don't think I should be in a place where I keep you from having [kids]."</p><p>That's right — in the end, Ty doesn't choose Megan or Melody. And both ladies leave the farm broken-hearted and confused. With the connection he had with both ladies all season that viewers could see, these ladies probably weren't the only confused ones.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why didn't Ty choose Melody or Megan?</h2><p>For Ty, Farmer Wants a Wife was about finding his "person," and someone he could build a life with. However, he needed someone who was ready for a life on the farm, and he didn't see that in Melody. Her life in New York City, and her family back home, made him realize he couldn't pursue her. During the reunion, Ty stands behind his decision.</p><p>"I'd rather be honest and be real with them and know that I gave them the truth even though it hurt, he explains.</p><p>Although Megan made comments this season about being a "bonus mom" to Ty's daughter, and she appeared OK with just that, Ty felt differently. He decides not to pick Megan because he doesn't want to deprive her of a chance to have kids somewhere down the line. It's not the ending anyone expected for Ty and the ladies, but it's the one we got.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecOonKxlpK56sbXCpGSfmaKisrN51pqlratdlnq4tcWe</p></div><div id=links><a href=./allison-hunt.html>&#171;&nbsp;Allison Hunt - Distractify</a>
