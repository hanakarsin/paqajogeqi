from Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State who fought and defeated ‘godfatherism’.</p><p>Olajengbesi recalled that Oshiomhole had vowed that Obaseki won’t return as governor after a term of four years

inability of the military to contain the situation despite several calls for it to act.</p><p>In his remarks, Senate President Ahmad Lawan said the repeated cases of kidnappings and killings make it imperative for the military to “wake up” to protect Nigerians.</p><p>The Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun has vowed to deal with internet fraudsters, popularly known as ‘Yahoo Boys’ and other criminals.</p><p>Governor Abiodun stated this on Wednesday while noting that the criminals threatened to come after him following his decision to wage war against them.</p><p>The Ogun State Governor

heat of the newly relaunched security outfit.</p><p>Abiodun who spoke in a meeting with the Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde said criminals have decided to go after him because he had made life unbearable for them.</p><p>The federal government of Nigeria has admitted that all is not well with the nation’s economic situation and efforts must be re-engineered to correct the situation.</p><p>Speaking differently at the same occasion, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Senate President Ahmad Lawan submitted that despite government efforts and commitment, the economy is facing difficult challenges.</p><p>Naija News reports the two top officials spoke through their representatives at the 40th Anniversary of the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CITN), in Abuja on

over-reliance of the country’s economy on oil which he said is causing economic imbalance.</p><p>A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Shehu Sani, has condemned the proposed plan to scrap the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).</p><p>Naija News earlier reported that a bill seeking to scrap the security agency passed the first reading in the House of Representatives on Tuesday.</p><p>The bill, sponsored by Hon Shina Peller (APC-Oyo State), was read on the floor of the lower legislative chamber during Tuesday’s plenary.</p><p>If passed by the National Assembly, the bill will repeal the National Security and Civil Defence Corps (Amendment) Act 2007.</p><p>Reacting to the development on Wednesday, the former Kaduna Central Senator described
