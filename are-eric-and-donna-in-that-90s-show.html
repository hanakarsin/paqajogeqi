That '70s Show premiered nearly 25 years ago on Aug. 23, 1998. And while no one could describe it as innovative, what it lacked in a fresh premise it more than made up for in its incredible characters and the actors who brought them to life. The fact that most of the cast went on to do incredible things is a testament to what they were doing, and what they could do in other roles.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Sadly (or not, depending on who you ask), That '80s Show only lasted one season and was clearly a paltry substitute. Now, a new sequel and decade are about to drop and we're hopeful that it fares better than its most recent predecessor.</p><p>That '90s Show brings us back to Wisconsin and into the bosom of the basement we grew to love in the original series.

The reboot is all about their daughter Leia (Callie Haverda) — as in <a href=#>Princess Leia</a>, of course — visiting her grandparents in Wisconsin while on summer break from school.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> confirmed that both Topher Grace and Laura Prepon would be reprising their roles as Eric and Donna for guest appearances.

Initially that answer was a hard no, but the seed had been planted. "We thought about it some more, and we said 'no' again," Terry Turner told the outlet.</p><p>The suggestion came during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown, when the Turners had a bit more time to come up with an idea for the show that would really work. Initially they considered having a love child of Eric's, but not Donna's, show up on Red and Kitty's doorstep — but Netflix quickly squashed that idea.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>In order to get the juices flowing, Bonnie and Terry hit up former That '70s Show and 3rd Rock From the Sun writer Gregg Mettler. They also enlisted the help of their daughter, Lindsey Turner. The four of them were finally able to get somewhere and that somewhere was the '90s.</p><p>"The thing that Gregg said that I really loved, and I know mom and dad did too, was the ‘90s was the last time that people were looking up, they weren’t looking down at their phones," Lindsey told Variety.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>The cast of 'That '90s Show'</p></figure><p>It didn't take long for the pieces to fall in place after that. Many old crew members from That '70s Show also returned. The original theme song was given a '90s revamp from <a href=#>Smashing Pumpkins</a> guitarist James Iha, and the old set was built again with a few updates. "I’ll never forget walking on the soundstage the first time and seeing the set again," Bonnie revealed. "I had all kinds of feelings. I was weeping."</p><p>Will fans of That '70s Show be weeping as well?
