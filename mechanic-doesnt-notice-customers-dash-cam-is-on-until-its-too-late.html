He went on to say that they're going to let him "sit an hour" because he's a "f----- a------."</p><p>Commenters who saw that video were divided: there were some who said that they believed the TIkToker probably deserved their negative treatment from the employee for the way that they were acting upon entering the store.</p><p>But there were others who thought it was a scary example of the type of work, or lack thereof, or even sabotage an auto mechanic may do out of spite to a customer's vehicle if they happened to not like the way that they were acting when they entered their shop.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@e4_nf6 href=#>@e4_nf6</a><p>Replying to @arexree Keep that dash cam hidden and recording.

The Honda Civic owner uploaded a snippet of the news story, which shows a rep from the company, rocking a mask as they speak into the camera, stating that they apologize for the treatment they received on behalf of one of its workers.</p><p>"There's no excuse for the way my employees acted," the gentleman says into the camera.
