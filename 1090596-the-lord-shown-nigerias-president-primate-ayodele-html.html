When the president returns, his government will continue to fluctuate, this is almost certain. Buhari has a good vision for this country, but his health condition is his bane.</p><p class=align-left>He will be back in approximately three months.</p><p class=align-left>At the moment, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is doing really well and can do better but will have a lot of challenges because there will be a lot of political games that will be played with the position. The right people to do it will be held to ransom.</p><p class=align-left>Right now, the Lord has given me some names of people that will take Nigeria forward, but I am not revealing them just yet. Those jostling now are not even part of them. Let us pray that we do not disintegrate as a nation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6i9rnmrksoc.jpeg><p class=align-left>The Lord told me that there is a need to act on the presidency because, like I told you some months ago, there is a curse on the seat of the president since the time of Tafawa Balewa, and if this is not reversed, there is no one who will not have one misfortune or another. The people in power should take note.</p><p class=align-left>Fridays and Sundays should be dedicated to prayers for the Villa and this is the role of all religious leaders in the country.</p><p class=align-left>2019 will break northern Nigeria and the All Progressives Congress. Makarfi will not get justice at the Supreme Court while Atiku will return to the PDP and most of the people there who want to contest will not get a ticket. The former vice president may not achieve his mission there because Sheriff has a mission.</p><p class=align-left>I see a new party, a kind of strong alliance is coming; it is neither PDP nor APC.</p><p class=h3><strong>PDP lawmakers' defection in Lagos: Fayose, Fani-Kayode, Wike, Reno Omokri only oppositions in Nigeria</strong></p><p class=align-left>The Lagos lawmakers who defected from the PDP to the APC are part of those destroying our democracy and are making it weak because when there is no opposition, our politics will no longer be interesting.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Fani-Kayode attacks Adesina over call from President Buhari</p><p class=align-left>Those lawmakers are a disgrace to their constituency and a shame to democracy. Even Jesus had critics when he was here on earth with us. Those lawmakers are the elements killing our democracy, APC should not have allowed them because people wasted their votes by electing such people into power.</p><p class=align-left>APC was such a strong opposition in 2015 and see how they came into power, this is what democracy should be all about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6feefuimht9.jpeg><p class=align-left>The only people in the PDP who are putting up strong opposition for the government of the day are the likes of Governor Ayodele Fayose, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, Governor Nyesom Wike and this former aide of ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri. Others are just fighting for their pockets and selfish interests.</p><p class=align-left>Nnamani, Uba and other former PDP strong men who defected to APC are not good party members. The way Fayose and others that I mentioned above are, they are putting the APC on their toes.</p><p class=align-left>That is why Tinubu will remain a frontline leader who will be respected in Yorubaland, Nigeria and the world over, because since he began in the opposition, he has remained there and has turned things around as an opposition.</p><p class=h3><strong>Economy: CBN governor must go, only an Igbo man can take us out of recession</strong></p><p class=align-left>I will keep saying this until the federal government does something about is; the CBN governor has to leave his post for someone better. He should be removed and replaced with somebody who understands what Nigeria's economic situation is all about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkytpe9maq91tis.jpeg><p class=align-left>An Igbo man should head the economic team and recession will come to an end. The minister of Finance should also be removed but it unfortunate that the government is not likely to accept those who will take us out of recession; only an Igbo man can take us out of recession.</p><p class=align-left>The rise in dollar is something I predicted earlier and with what is presently happening, I see it getting worse. Nigeria should neglect dollar and have a tie with China and see what happens afterwards.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Naira firms to N460 per dollar at parallel market</p><p class=h3><strong>Southern Kaduna</strong></p><p class=align-left>Like I said weeks ago, I have to visit Southern Kaduna first hand to see things for myself before commenting on the issue. Christians and Muslims should get to the root of the matter before involving the government officials.</p><p class=align-left>It is something we should work on before it degenerates into a national religious war. As a prophet, I don't want to talk about what I have not seen and I also need to pray and seek the face of the Lord for solutions to these challenges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4io20tiec5b.jpeg><p class=align-left>We must find those people who are behind this crisis in Southern Kaduna. We want peace in the religious sect of our nation and not war.</p><p class=align-left>After the conversation, the primate also gave a hint on a project he has been working on for some time.</p><p class=align-left><i>"I have a building somewhere in Lagos which I am putting up and will donate for inter-religious worship. This is my way of uniting the Muslims and Christians in the country. When we are done with this project, we shall invite you all to witness the unveiling,"</i> he said.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnGFj25wb2WknbJuuM6rm2armKTEr3nNop6eqpmWwG680Z6qopyVo8FuvNGipJqslWKuurvDnqOeZpipuq0%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./63044-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Check Out 2face Idibia's Customized Jewelry Microphone</a>
