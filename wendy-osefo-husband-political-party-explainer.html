She's most likely going to be your new hero. Here's everything you need to know about her politics and family life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Ahead of tonight's <a href=#>season premiere</a> of <a href=#>Real Housewives of Potomac</a>, we know a little bit about newcomer Wendy Osefo, a Nigerian-born Johns Hopkins University professor, political analyst and commentator, and entrepreneur. Wendy is the embodiment of self-made success; she grew up with a single immigrant mother and paid her own way through college. She has multiple degrees, and, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bio page on Bravo</a>, she's the first Black woman to get a PhD in Public Affairs/Community Development at Rutgers University.&nbsp;</p><p>Before she became a professor at Johns Hopkins, she was the Director of Family and Community Engagement for Barack Obama's program to fight poverty, the DC Promise Neighborhood Initiative. We also know that she's been married to her husband, attorney Edward Osefo, for nine years. The two have three children together. Curious to know more about this absolute powerhouse? Read on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wendy Osefo's involvement with politics, explained.</h2><p>Wendy was involved in the Obama administration, so it's safe to assume she identifies as a Democrat. Or at the very least, Wendy is certainly anti-Trump.&nbsp;</p><p>On July 21, Wendy posted a clip from a Fox News segment in which she was featured defending Joe Biden, telling viewers that Americans are sick of Trump bullying the Democratic candidate down when he could be addressing what needs to be done to protect citizens from the impacts of COVID-19 and making sure Black lives are protected.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@cthagod has done a lot for the culture, so I had to set the record straight. All successful black men are not rappers ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ. ‚Äî #Repost @cthagod ... Salute to Queen @wendyosefo for educating @mschlapp I‚Äôm sending her a bottle of some expensive ass wine for holding black men down like this!!!! ‚ÄúRapper‚Äù is a stereotypical trope that successful black men get labeled all the time because for whatever reason when some white people do see us they can‚Äôt see us as anything else. I mean I‚Äôm clearly to short to be labeled a basketball player so the only way I could be in first class on a flight or on your tv talking to a presidential candidate is because I rap right? I‚Äôm not going to call this man a racist, I‚Äôm a just say he has a cultural blind spot. I‚Äôm the type to counsel someone not ‚Äúcancel‚Äù them. I can‚Äôt fault him for what he doesn‚Äôt know, maybe I look like I got bars. Plus I love RAP!!! So being referred to as a RAP STAR I would call that a positive stereotype, but a stereotype none the less. Anyway, the moral of the story is contrary to this Caucasians culturally clueless belief all Black men you see on TV are not rappers and athletes. The End.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Dr. Wendy Osefo, PhD</a> (@wendyosefo) on Jul 21, 2020 at 7:02am PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Wendy has been incredibly outspoken about Black Lives Matter, posting a clip that illustrates her viewpoints.</p><p>"Please understand that people know EXACTLY what we mean when we say #BlackLivesMatter.
