Brainstorm</h3><p class=align-left>10 ideas are way too many, even for the most popular person who has a long list of friends attending his birthday.

By the end of your brainstorming session, you will have a list of items that mean the most to you.</p><h3>2. Choose physical items</h3><p class=align-left>Physical items make perfect gifts because they can be sent to you even when your loved ones are too busy to bring them. They can be bought online, which saves a lot of time. Furthermore, if they are expensive, a group of friends can come together and make the purchase together to save on money.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/888d9678997ecf2e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 amazing wedding card messages you can use on that special occasion</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Highlight all the physical items in your list and separate them from the rest.

Choose experiences</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f201313e463a0d71.png><p class=align-left>Your list will have some gifts that cannot be bought and sent to you. You might want to go on a trip, attend a concert, attend a cooking class or have a spa day. These experiences require some of your loved ones to accompany you.</p><p class=align-left>Consider their schedules and availability. Also, pay attention to their interests as it would be unfair to have them accompany you on a trip they do not enjoy. Based on these considerations, remove or add items to your list.</p><h3>4. Narrow down your wish list</h3><p class=align-left>At this point, your list has physical items and experiences that are practical and affordable. Think about the pros and cons of each item. Think about what matters more to you. You should also consider how long you will use the item and whether it is worth buying. Narrow down your list to a few items.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d7cf097f31ae6c0e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 birthday wishes for love: best messages and quotes for your better half</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Every year, you might find yourself wondering, “What do I want for my birthday?” From this list of 10 items, get fresh ideas on what your loved ones can buy for you.
