today, Wednesday, 9th August 2023.</h2><p>President Bola Tinubu has expressed his resolute commitment to break the vicious cycle of overreliance on borrowing for public spending.</p><p>The Nigerian leader also promised to end the resulting burden of debt servicing it places on the management of Nigeria’s limited government revenues.</p><p>In a statement on Tuesday by his spokesman, Ajuri Ngelale, the President made the promise during the inauguration of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, chaired by Taiwo Oyedele.</p><p>The President charged the committee to improve the country’s revenue profile and business environment as the Federal Government moves to achieve an 18% Tax-to-GDP ratio within three years.</p><p>President Tinubu directed the Committee to achieve its one-year mandate, which is divided into three main areas: fiscal governance, tax reforms, and growth facilitation.</p><p>The Nigerian Senate has transmitted the confirmed list of ministerial nominees to President Bola Tinubu upon the conclusion of its legislative duties.</p><p>This was confirmed to newsmen on Tuesday by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly matters, Senator Abdullah Gumel.</p><p>It would be recalled that the upper chamber of the National Assembly on Monday, completed and confirmed the screening of 45 out of the 48 ministerial nominees forwarded to it by President Tinubu.</p><p>World Trade Organisation’s Director-General, Professor Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, affirmed her commitment to aiding Nigeria during its hardships after her discussion with President Bola Tinubu.</p><p>Okonjo-Iweala, alongside former Health Minister, Mohammed Ali Pate, emphasized potential grassroots programs to benefit young individuals and women.</p><p>The WTO chief highlighted the organization’s interest in enhancing trade for Nigeria, pinpointing sectors such as agriculture, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Also speaking, Dr. Pate said that President Tinubu was fully aware of the difficulties people are facing and that efforts are being made to alleviate them.</p><p>The spokesman of the 10th Senate, Yemi Adaramodu on Tuesday revealed why the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio visited the Presidential Villa on Monday.</p><p>According to Adaramodu, Akpabio did not visit President Bola Tinubu because of the drama in the senate over the screening of a ministerial nominee, Festus Keyamo.</p><p>The lawmaker representing Ekiti South Senatorial District disclosed this on Tuesday during an interview on Channels TV.</p><p>Adaramodu claimed that the Senate President had planned to visit the Villa before the uproar in the Red Chamber over Keyamo’s nomination.</p><p>He further stated that Akpabio’s visit to the Villa on Monday was on the coup in Niger Republic.</p><p>A Labour Party (LP) chieftain, Doyin Okupe, has replied to some supporters of the party popularly known as the ‘Obidients’ who insulted him a few days ago over his comment on President Bola Tinubu’s action against the Niger Republic.</p><p>Naija News reported that Okupe came under heavy criticism last weekend after he commended President Tinubu over the steps taken on Niger Republic following the ousting of democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum by the new military government.</p><p>Okupe, who was reacting to the Nigerian leader’s actions, had said in a post via his Twitter page that there is a need to protect democracy, and Nigerians must not be quiet due to internal differences.</p><p>He noted that irrespective of who the president is, Nigerians and political leaders must unite in defence of the country.</p><p>However, some netizens perceived to be supporters of LP have frowned on Okupe’s call to support Tinubu.</p><p>In his latest response to the backlash on social media, Okupe maintained that he does not play politics with bitterness.</p><p>While debunking the reports of collecting money from the All Progressives Congress (APC) after supporting Peter Obi of the Labour Party in the last presidential election, Okupe said he should have become a multi-billionaire if he had gone into politics for money.</p><p>The Labour Party chieftain said he had no regrets whatsoever for his actions.</p><p>The Economic Community Of West Africa States (ECOWAS) on Tuesday imposed fresh sanctions over the coup in Niger Republic.</p><p>Naija News understands that ECOWAS had earlier given coup leaders in Niger seven days to reinstate President Mohamed Bazoum or risk sanctions, including possible military action.</p><p>The coup leaders, however, did not feel threatened by the decree of ECOWAS and vowed to resist any foreign intervention on its soil.</p><p>Presidential spokesman, Ajuri Ngeale while addressing State House correspondents on Tuesday said more sanctions had been imposed on the individuals and entities relating with the military junta in the Niger Republic.</p><p>Although he did not go into details, he said this was carried out through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p><p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) has accused Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki of inciting the people of the state against President Bola Tinubu.</p><p>The party in a statement on Tuesday however cautioned the Governor against such moves, saying Obaseki is only trying to shift the blame of his failure in seven years of governance on someone who has not even used three months in office.</p><p>Naija News reports the APC in the statement signed by its publicity secretary South-South Zonal Organising Secretary, Blessing Agbomhere was reacting directly to an earlier statement by Obaseki through his Special Adviser on Media Projects, Crusoe Osagie in which he accused the Tinubu government of inflicting suffering on the people through his fuel subsidy removal policy.</p><p>The Edo Governor had also blamed the APC-led federal government for being responsible for the state of many deplorable roads in the state.</p><p>However, the APC statement said the Edo State governor has “found a convenient way of putting the blame of his total failure on the less than three months old administration of President Tinubu which came into office with the road map of removing the burdensome fuel subsidy which has become a huge drain on the meagre revenue of the Federal Government.”</p><p>Obaseki was accused of having nothing to show forth as achievements in government since taking over from Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as the Edo State Governor and urged to desist from blaming others for his failure.</p><p>The spokesperson of the 10th Senate, Yemi Adaramodu on Tuesday gave an update on the confirmation of former governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai and other ministerial nominees.</p><p>According to Adaramodu, the red chamber may re-invite the three ministerial nominees yet to be confirmed for re-screening.</p><p>Adaramodu representing Ekiti South Senatorial District revealed this during an interview on Channels TV on Tuesday.</p><p>The lawmaker when asked whether the Senate is still going to confirm those yet to be confirmed said, “The question raised about them is an ongoing issue. So, once the Senate is satisfied, definitely, if we need to invite them to the chamber for the re-confirmation and re-screening, then we’ll do that.”</p><p>Former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olabode George, has again warned President Bola Tinubu against invading Niger Republic.</p><p>According to him, Tinubu and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which he is currently chairing, have enough room to dialogue with leaders of the Niger coup.</p><p>George, who spoke during an interview with Arise Television on Tuesday (today), said a country has to consider its national interest before considering going to war.</p><p>Naija News reports that George had earlier cautioned President Tinubu against invading Niger Republic in a bid to restore ousted President Mohamed Bazoum to power.</p><p>Recalled that on July 25, 2023, General Abdourahamane Tchiani-led Presidential Guard had detained and taken over power from Bazoum.</p><p>Following the coup, ECOWAS imposed sanctions on the Niger Republic while also threatening military intervention.</p><p>Reacting, however, in a letter addressed to the Nigerian leader, George warned Tinubu to think deeply before intervening in the Niger crisis.</p><p>President Bola Tinubu has inaugurated the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms.</p><p>Naija News reports that the inauguration took place on Tuesday at the Council Chamber of the Presidential Villa in Abuja.</p><p>In his speech, President Tinubu said the federal government cannot continue to tax poverty when it is supposed to promote prosperity.</p><p>Recall that the President had on July 7 approved the establishment of the Committee headed by a former Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Taiwo Oyedele.</p><p>According to a statement from the presidency, the establishment of the committee is in consonance with his promise to remove all barriers impeding business growth in the country.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
