Some of the troubles that slow us down as a nation include:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/750623d3de43fbd7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>12 richest people in Tanzania in 2024 and their net worth</span></p></a><h3>Financial constraints</h3><p class=align-left>The biggest challenge to the implementation of SDGs in Kenya the SDG’s is financing, <a href=# title="sdgs report" rel="nofollow noopener">as reported by Gideon Mailu</a>. He adds that developed countries committed 0.75 percent of their budget to help developing countries, a matter that has not materialized. Mailu denoted that successful development programs are funded mainly by donors. Take an example of the country’s healthcare programs. Over 50 percent of Kenya’s healthcare programs are donor-funded which has contributed to the growth and development of the sector.</p><h3>Insufficient sustainability of available solutions</h3><p class=align-left>While most of the SDGSs are achievable, we still face the trouble of delivering sustainable solutions that will ensure the problems the development goals are addressing won’t come to haunt us in future. Sustainability is the main concept in sustainable development goals. The fact that our country is still chasing after curing symptoms and not addressing causes makes it hard to fully implement these goals. For instance, supplying balanced diet food to communities that face perennial hunger will not address the solution in a sustainable way yet we are still caught in such races.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs77qqoue8oip.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Big Four Agenda of the government explained</span></p></a><h3>Lack of cohesion and one mindedness</h3><p class=align-left>The Kenyan society, just like any other capitalist society, is focused on personal betterment. We are more interested in bettering ourselves and our immediate kin as opposed to national prosperity. This tendency means that sustainable development projects will rarely be evenly distributed as people in power tend to channel resources towards projects they feel benefit their immediate interests.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>KPLC customer care number and emergency number</p><h2>Sustainable Development Goals in Kenya and UNDP’s Role</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs247bcjmmuc1.jpeg><p class=align-left>According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Administrator, Helen Clark, supporting Agenda 2030 is a top priority for UNDP. “The SDGs provide us with a common plan and agenda to tackle some of the pressing challenges facing our world such as poverty, climate change, and conflict.

Vision 2030 is designed to be fulfilled through MTPs (Medium Term Plans) which are 5-year rolling terms.

The advocate for fewer, smarter targets insists that 17 goals with 169 targets will encounter financial difficulties. As <a href=# title="sdgs in kenya, implementation of sdgs in kenya, sdgs launch in kenya" rel="nofollow noopener">he reported to The Star</a>, there is no adequate financing on these goals. The so-called private sector cannot deliver the country from its woes since it only spends money on what it deems worthy. Concerning the SDGs implementation in Kenya, Dr. Lomborg claims that once the government agrees to adopt all 169 targets, it is likely to do a small portion and instead, it was better if they had focused on fewer smarter goals. In the meeting that was to be held in New York, he advised the country to cut down on the least effective targets and focus on the most effective. Dr. Lomborg criticized the 169 targets insisting that they were repetitive and blurry since each lobby pitched its own interests.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/72533a66d2fcd60e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Guide on GIZ Kenya programmes, office locations and how to contact them</span></p></a><h2>Medium Term Plans (MTP)</h2><p class=align-left>Term Plans were created as a short-term means of meeting long-term objectives. MTPs are a series of successive 5-year plans that will steer the country to meeting Vision 2030.</p><h2>MTP (2008-2012)</h2><p class=align-left>The goal of the first Medium Term Plan of 2008-2012 was to implement flagship projects that were identified in accordance to Vision 2030. Other major programs and policies over the previous 5 years were also included. On financing and investment of the programs, the greater share of finances came from the private sector under the Public Private Partnerships (PPP) program. The ratio of domestic savings to GDP was projected to increase from 16 percent to 26 percent while that of investment to GDP was projected to increase by 10 percent in 5 years.</p><h2>Public-Private Partnership (PPP/P3/P3)</h2><p class=align-left>Public-Private Partnership a joint venture between the government and the private sector, whereby both contribute to achieving a goal of common interest. The private sector, in this case, may be one or more private businesses such as private companies. A PPP program implies a contract between a public company and a private corporation whereby the private party agrees to oversee a project, assuming full responsibility for the financial, technical, and operational risks. The president assented the Public-Private Partnerships Bill of 2012 in January 2013. The bill sought to facilitate key development projects by increasing the funding capacity. At the moment, the country has up to 6 major projects entailing infrastructure, energy, transport and others, all with a combined total of 4 Trillion Kenya Shillings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs6umf1q1a99r.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 most developed countries in Africa in 2018</span></p></a><h2>MTP (2013-2017)</h2><p class=align-left>The second and current medium-term plan seeks to position the economic state of the country in a path to achieving 10 percent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate annually by 2017.

The Social Pillar</h3><p class=align-left>The social pillar endeavors to establish a just and cohesive society that lives in a clean environment.</p><h3>3.

The MDGs were 8 in total with 21 targets that governments all over the world promised to achieve between 2000 and 2015. MDGs were then succeeded by the currently undergoing SDGs when MDGs reached their expiration period. The director of the devolution insisted that Kenya must out-perform other countries in the world in the realization of these SDGs as it led the world in creating them. This worldwide process of creating new goals was co-chaired by Dr. Macharia Kamau, the permanent representative to the United Nations. Head of Kenya Manufacturers Association, Betty Maina, sat on the panel of eminent persons during the post-2015 development agenda for the East and South African region, as appointed by the secretary to the United Nations in 2012. A factor attributed to the success of the first MDGs was the active participation of donors in contributing money to end issues like maternal and child deaths.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9b969debf3ac4244.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 12 companies offering attachment opportunities in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals are significantly intertwined, it is good to look at what MDGs achieved:</p><ul><li>Over a billion people have been alleviated from poverty as from 1990</li><li>HIV/AIDS contractions reduced by a massive 40 percent since 2000</li><li>Children dropping out of school has reduced by over half since 1990</li><li>Child mortality rate also decreased by over 50 percent</li></ul><p class=align-left>During SDGs launch in Kenya, Gideon Mailu insisted that the lessons and experience garnered through the legacy and achievement of MDGs is vital in achieving the current SDGs. However, MDGs remain unachieved for millions around the world. Matters of world concern in developing countries include hunger, gender inequality, poor health, and poor education. The Sustainable Development Goals are a means of shifting the world to a sustainable path. Often, the Sustainable Development Goals are interconnected, whereby tackling one issue requires matters associated with another item in the list. For example, good education heavily relies on the good health of the pupils, since they cannot go to good schools yet they are sick. One of the key aims highlighted during SDGs launch in Kenya is to get every child beyond primary school. In dealing with climatic change and its risk factors, there will be direct implications on how each county manages its fragile physical resources. Better health and gender equality will reflect on poverty reduction, while inclusive societies that foster peace will lower inequalities and help economies to prosper. Similarly, innovation and economic growth go hand in hand as new technology increases the value of exports. Success in one SDG will mean success in another. Simply put, SDGs are the best chance any country has of improving life for subsequent generations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/85d5adc973a78cd5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The history of entrepreneurship in Kenya and its evolution</span></p></a><p class=align-left>SDGs rely on the spirit of partnership on making the right choices as well as improving life sustainably for future generations. The sustainable development goals provide clear and concise targets that each country can adopt per their priorities and the environmental affairs of the world at large.

The goals endeavor is to unite different nations while making a positive difference for the people and the planet.</p><p class=align-left>‘Project everyone’ was Standard Chartered Bank’s initiative to spread the word to the citizens on SDGs.
